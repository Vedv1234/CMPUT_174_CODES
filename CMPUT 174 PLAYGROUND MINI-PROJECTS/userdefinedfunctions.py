# Functionality of code: This is my first experiment with creating a simple function
# that makes coffee. It helped me understand basic function definition and calling.

# My example of a function with no parameters that returns None
def make_coffee():
    # I'm hardcoding the coffee type as 'black'
    type_of_coffee = 'black'
    # Printing my coffee message
    print(f'Here is your delicious cup of {type_of_coffee} coffee')

# Calling my coffee making function
make_coffee()
