# Functionality of code: This is my third version of the board game where I've added
# win/lose conditions and a game loop. Players can now win by visiting all squares
# at least once, or lose by visiting the same square too many times.

max_visits = 3    # I'll use this to limit how many times a square can be visited

    # My function to calculate the new position with wraparound
    new_position = (previous_position + roll) % len(board)
    return new_position

    # I'm checking two conditions for game over:
    # 1. If any square is visited max times (lose)
    # 2. If all squares are visited at least once (win)
    if max_visits in board or 0 not in board:
        return True
