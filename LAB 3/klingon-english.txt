Black Panther (2018) and mainstream narrative
“Black Panther”  directed by Ryan Coogler stands out as a groundbreaking film as it uses the brilliance of Murray Smith’s structure of sympathy to solicit viewer character engagement and heighten the relatability  for underrepresentation of oppressed groups in society ranging from African victims of colonial rule to women who face sexual discrimination. Black Panther’s effectively uses this technique to touch those who have been oppressed and give them a visualization of how their own kind would thrive if social justice is served.

This first element of Smith's structure of sympathy, Recognition, is used efficiently to address the first oppressed group which are people of colour. For years, in the real world they have faced colonial oppression and many fell victims to inhumane colonial laws that made them forget what a wealthy and free life would look like.Black Panther presents Wakanda and its citizen as a city flourishing with wealth and prosperity. People of colour rejoice to see their own kind on the big-screen living a comfortable and joyful life under the King T'challa, many living abroad are able to connect with their homeland and their roots.From the accent of the characters,costumes and even the choice of the pre-dominantly black cast.The accent appearing to lean towards the nigerian language reminds the viewer of the beautiful language that they once spoke at home expressing themselves freely. The costumes including ornaments themselves are an embodiment of rich African culture and heritage, they help to make the viewer feel as if the cast played on screen was one of their own. The black cast ofcourse stands out as the industry rarely sees a black character play a super-hero role and it gives the black viewer feel represented as society always advertises the wrong-doing of poeple of colour like robberies but this film shows that how moral heights that poeple of colour behold.

In addition, women are another oppressed group, for years they have not been given equal importance as men in their workplaces, the story setting of Wakanda exhibits the power of women employment with many lead roles played by female characters. and the female characters are shown not only working as low-ranking workers but rather as innovators of technology like the sister who always strives to innovate.
