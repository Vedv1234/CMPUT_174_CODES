# Functionality of code: I made this fun little program to imitate Homer Simpson's 
# famous "Mmm..." food reactions! Just type in any food and it'll respond exactly 
# like Homer would. It's simple but definitely captures Homer's spirit!

# I'm asking the user what food they want Homer to drool over
user_food_entered = input(" What is the tasty thing? ")

# Now I'm making Homer respond with his classic "Mmm..." line
print(f"Mmm... {user_food_entered}!")
